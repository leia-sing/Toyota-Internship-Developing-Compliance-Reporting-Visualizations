## Toyota Internship Project: Developing Compliance Reporting Visualizations

**Here are my 3 compliance reporting visualization contributions in a nutshell:**

- **Project 1: Visualizing Facility Environmental Compliance Status** – I transformed textual compliance data into an intuitive visual format, enabling quick assessments across 11 facilities in a 3 year period. Introduced a Python-based approach to streamline a repetitive data transformation step.
- **Project 2: Visualizing Issue Log Data** – Connected SharePoint data to Power BI and composed performance metrics to evaluate issue logs, enhancing accessibility and insights for stakeholders.
- **Project 3: Visualizing Privacy Page for Executive Dashboard** – Initiated discussions and prototyped a Privacy page for the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) Dashboard, aligning reporting with executive compliance priorities.

## Project 1 — Visualizing Facility Environmental Compliance Status

The available compliance data was in text format, making it cumbersome to analyze for 11 facilities over 13 quarters.

I transformed this textual data into intuitive icon-based visuals, allowing quick at-a-glance compliance assessments.

When creating this visualization, I observed that the existing process for data transformation in Power BI was repetitive and manual, and I identified it as an opportunity for process improvement. By developing a Python-based solution, I increased the efficiency of a time-consuming step that mapped textual data to icons, enhancing both speed and accuracy of delivering visualized compliance reporting.

As a result of my efforts, the newly visualized dashboard of compliance statuses allowed a compliance analyst to quickly and accurately assess status of 11 facilities for over a 3 year time period.

## Project 2 — Visualizing Issue Log Data

In this project, I pulled EHS Issue Log data from SharePoint, imported the data to Power BI, configured fields to visualize initial discoveries in Power BI.

Wanting to go further beyond the given numbers given for issue logs, I introduced new metrics to aid compliance analysts in evaluating trends in issue logs. Instead of analyzing issue logs by rote numbers, analysts could now view ratios of the following:
- Of the total number of issues, the X% which had been escalated
- Of the total number of issues, the X% which received a citation
- Of the total number of escalated issues, the X% which received a citation

## Project 3 — Visualizing Privacy Page for Executive Dashboard

1. **Identifying a Business Need** – While attending a department meeting, I recognized that a recently prioritized executive dashboard shown to the CCO did not have a page yet for the Privacy team. Sensing an opportunity, I proactively initiated discussions with my team on the dashboard page as a possible project.
2. **Business Considerations for Dashboard Design** – As I engaged with a privacy stakeholder, I learned to consider:
   - **Audience** – Ensuring insights were relevant to the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO).
   - **Value** – Aligning privacy rights data with executive compliance priorities.
   - **Differentiation** – Determining how this visualization provided unique insights beyond existing reports.
3. **Prototype Development** – Although time constraints limited full implementation, I led discussions, gathered requirements, and created an initial prototype visualization. 

In this screenshot of prototype page, the following visualizations are shown: 
- indicators for the status of laws in different states (to show scope of states with certain privacy regulations)
- volume of privacy rights requests (to see how consumer demand for exercising rights changes based on time of year)
- request breakdown (since rights are part of a regulation, the purpose of showing request breakdown would be to evidence Toyota's compliance to the entire regulation, down to the right)

## Learnings
- By working on the facility environmental visualizations, I had the opportunity to strengthen my problem-solving and process improvement skills, particularly through noticing manual tasks and developing a solution using Python to enhance compliance tracking efficiency.

- While I faced a time constraint to fully go through the process of creating a finalized page with the time I had at Toyota, I was able to experience the initial discussions and questions that go into creating a dashboard--namely, establishing business value of the dashboard beyond current existing reporting, and considering ways to frame the analysis to maximize relevance to the audience.
